Hello, everyone. I have a problem with my 2 wifi camera Dafang model DF3. I was able to connect to the mi home application, 
the blue LED is on but no picture. When I choose the camera and want to see a preview of the image, unfortunately a message appears
"Use only in mainland China"
I've purchased two cameras 2018 and they works excellent about 3 month, then they suddenly stop. 
I've olso had purchased exactly the same camera 2017 which still works? 
Can someone help me with this issue.
